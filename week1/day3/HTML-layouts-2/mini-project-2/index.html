          <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
              dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
              pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
              foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
              blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
              will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
              pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
              In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
              nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
              pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
              circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
              business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
              and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
              matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
              other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
